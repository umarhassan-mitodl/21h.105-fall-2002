  "course_description": "\"What then is the American, this new man?\" asked J. Hector St-John de Cr\u00e8vecoeur in his _Letters from an American Farmer_ in 1782. This subject takes Cr\u00e8vecoeur's question as the starting point for an examination of the changing meanings of national identity in the American past. We will consider a diverse collection of classic texts in American history to see how Americans have defined themselves and their nation in politics, literature, art, and popular culture. As a communications-intensive subject, students will be expected to engage intensively with the material through frequent oral and written exercises.\n",
